About `headers[XX].sty`
=======================


I beg your pardon for my english...
===================================

English is not my native language, so be nice if you notice misunderstandings, misspellings, or grammatical errors in my documents and codes.


About
=====

Every documentation of the project proposed by the monorepo `typensee-latex` used the same formatting.
This is obtained by using the same `headers[XX].sty` file where `XX` is the language of the documentation.
At this time, just the French is supported so there is only a single file `headers[fr].sty` maintained.
