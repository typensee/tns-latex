About `bcdoc`
=============


I beg your pardon for my english...
===================================

English is not my native language, so be nice if you notice misunderstandings, misspellings, or grammatical errors in my documents and codes.


About
=====

Every documentation of the projects proposed by the monorepo `typensee-latex` used the same formatting obtained by using the package `bcdoc`.

**Remark.** At this time, just the French is supported.
