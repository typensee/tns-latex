typensee-latex (monorepo) - ROADMAP
=========================

This file is a roadmap, in the short term.


-----------
ALWAYS DONE
-----------

    1) Use of a Python script to know if a name (macro/environment/...) is already used by a TeX Live project.

    2) New features are always tested at least with l3build.
        + Tests build from the docs: use of meta comments because
          some tests can need some specific settings.
        + Home-made tests can be added if necessary.

    3) tnscore
        + Abstraction from the last changes must be added as soon
          as possible!


----------
NEXT STEPS
----------

    1) Tab var et signe maison via un DSL dédié et aussi automatique possible via outil de son choix : voir comment appel giac par exemple

    2) Interval in a dedicated package
        + Writing
        + Drawing


    3) stepcalc & basic logic
        + \then ??? instead of \implies
          and
          \when ??? instead of \becauseof

        + New easy-to-use syntax, regarding the style:
            \explnext[top to bottom]<bottom to top>
          or
            \explnext[top to bottom ALONE]
          or
            \explnext<bottom to top ALONE>
          or
            \explnext{double side}
          (in a double-side case, the use of the first options will not be allowed).

        + Macro to facilitate the construction of specialized stepcalc environments like an iff environment, or an evaluation one for example. Use of expl3 template!
