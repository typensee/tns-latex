typensee-latex (monorepo) - ROADMAP
=========================

This temporary file is a roadmap, in the short term, that accompanies
the transition from a personal project, intended for my use only, to
a project distributed to the public through CTAN.



-----------
ALWAYS DONE
-----------

    1) Use of a Â¨python script to know if a name (macro/environment/...)
       is already used by a TeX Live project.

    2) New features are always tested at least with l3build. Home-made
       tests can be added if necessary.

    3) tnscore
        + Abstraction from the last changes must be added as soon as
          possible!



----------
NEXT STEPS
----------

    1) Interval in a dedicated package
        + Drawing
        + Writing

    2) stepcalc & basic logic
        + \then ??? instead of \implies
          and
          \when ??? instead of \becauseof

        + New easy-to-use syntax, regarding the style:
          \explnext[top to bottom]<bottom to top>
          or
          \explnext[double side]
          or
          \explnext<double side>
          (in a double-side case, the use of the two options will not
          be allowed).

        + Macro to facilitate the construction of specialized stepcalc
          environments like an iff environment, or an evaluation one
          for example.
