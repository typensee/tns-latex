typensee-latex (monorepo) - ROADMAP
=========================


This temporary file is a roadmap, in the short term, setting the course
for the transition from a personal project, intended for my use only,
to a project distributed to the public through CTAN.


----
NOTE
----

New features are always tested at least with l3build. Homemade tests
can be added.


----------
NEXT STEPS
----------

    1) tnscore
        + Abstraction from the last changes to add!

    2) stepcalc & basic logic
        + New easy-to-use syntax: \explnext[top to bottom]<bottom to top>,
          or \explnext[double side] regarding the style (in the second case,
          the use of a none empty < option > will not be allowed).

    3) interval alone
        + Drawing
        + Writing
