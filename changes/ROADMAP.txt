typensee-latex (monorepo) - ROADMAP
=========================

This file is a roadmap, in the short term.


-----------
ALWAYS DONE
-----------

    1) Use of a Python script to know if a name (macro/environment/...)
       is already used by a TeX Live project.

    2) New features are always tested at least with l3build.
        + Tests build from the docs: use of meta comments because
          some tests can need some specific settings.
        + Home-made tests can be added if necessary.

    3) tnscore
        + Abstraction from the last changes must be added as soon
          as possible!

    4) Semantics: make it possible to create YAML-style files giving information on the use of a macro for tools that will just do pattern matching in the TEX file.

    For example, \funcdef{f, x, \RR, x^2, \RR} will give :

    yaml::
        - "\funcdef{f, x, \RR, x^2, \RR}":
          - See what it says next ???


----------
NEXT STEPS
----------

    1) Function tab.: var/sign/val

    2) Interval in a dedicated package

        + Writing
        + Drawing

    3) stepcalc & basic logic
        + \then ??? instead of \implies
          and
          \when ??? instead of \becauseof

        + New easy-to-use syntax, regarding the style:
            \nextstep   % Nothing to say
          or
            \nextstep[top to bottom]<bottom to top>
          or
            \nextstep[top to bottom ALONE]
          or
            \nextstep<bottom to top ALONE>
          or
            \nextstep{double side}
          (in a double-side case, the use of the first options will not be allowed).

        + Macro to facilitate the construction of specialized stepcalc environments like an iff environment, or an evaluation one for example. Use of expl3 template!
