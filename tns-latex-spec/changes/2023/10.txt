Here is what has been improved.

    1) Aggregating \packs: in the path::``about.yaml`` file, the paths to the \packs to be aggregated must end in yaml::``/``.

    1) yaml::``toc`` block of a path::``about.yaml`` file: we just use what is indicated without automatically adding some remaining files, except for ext::``tex`` files associated with ext::``sty`` files.

    1) \Tech \doc: just the \src code is used (with the possibility of translations into languages other than English).

    1) Resource: no more analysis of the code \latex of the \doc typed by the coder but everything must pass via relative paths.

    1) Macros and starred \envs: no longer offered.

    1) Language support: the names to be used are those proposed by the \babel \pack.

    1) Non-retroactive changes: we act abruptly with no transition period (simpler to maintain and classic in the \latex world).

    1) The path::``build_`` prefix is no longer marked as to be ignored for the final product. If necessary, path::``tool_build_`` should be used as the prefix.

Several new features.

    1) Just for the path::``src/about.yaml`` file: the yaml::``texfacto`` block lets you specify a file to use as the header for the ext::``tex`` file in the user \doc.

    1) For any path::``about.yaml`` file, this is what has been added.

        + A yaml::``ignore`` block can be used to indicate files to be ignored locally or globally for the final product in addition to those of type path::``test_`` and path::``tool_``.

        + You can use the \glob syntax for the yaml::``toc`` and yaml::``ignore`` blocks.

    1) \Tech \docs.

        + A user \tech \doc and a hacker one are proposed.

        + Possibility of hiding some \signs just for the "simple user" version via the starred tnsdoc::``prototype*::``.

    1) About translatable content.

        + Naming uses two options depending on the context: either the verb::``ISO 639-1`` standard, or via the conventions of the \pack \babel.

        + The contributions folder looks like this:

        dirview::
            + contribute
                + doc
                    + changelog
                        + fr [...]
                    + manual
                        + fr [...]
                    + tech
                        + en [...]

:update:
--------

[[:api:]]
Project folder: the path::``contribute`` and path::``readme`` subfolders are optional.


[[:doc:]]
Many clarifications have been made.

    1) It has been clearly stated that for each \dev subfolder, the settings related to a language should be placed in a path::``locale`` subfolder.

    1) The \pdf files associated with a \ext::``tex`` file included in the user \doc will always be ignored in the final \prod.

    1) \Tech \docs: macros or \envs created dynamically via latex::``\csname`` type functions should be clearly explained in the \protos.

    1) ... \etc.

:fordev:

[[:tech:]]
Update relating to \tns: use of path::``?/`` instead of path::``:?../`` for systematic ascending/descending file and folder searches.
