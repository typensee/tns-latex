Change log for the user: the files for days can be suffixed to allow several new versions on the same day (this can be useful for the distracted coder like the man writing this text).

[[:api:]]
Here are all the breaking changes.

    1) Special tools for the user \doc: the magic comment ``% == FORDOC == %`` replaces the old ``% == NEEDED == %``.

    1) For non-aggregated packages, the yaml::``agregate`` block has been renamed yaml::``toc``.

    1) The setting macros used a name like ``SetTnsPackagename`` instead of ``settingtns``.

    1) The folders of the packages to be aggregated must be explicitly indicated (there will be no more recursive search).

\tnscore: the coding paradigm is more flexible.
